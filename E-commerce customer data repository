Exploratory data analysis EDA:
Sales stayed mostly between 14M to 16M every month – showing stable performance.
Some months show lower sales than usual, which could be due to seasonal reasons (like holidays or slow periods).
A sudden drop in sales appears near mid-2023, likely because data is missing or not fully recorded.
No clear increase or decrease over time – sales remained steady across the years.

All product category have similar total sales, around 160 million each.
Clothing and Electronics have slightly higher sales, but the difference is small.
This indicates the company has a well- balanced product mix – no single category dominates.
It may useful to focus on optimizing equally, rather than just one.

Clothing has the highest number of items sold among all categories.
Home, Electronics, and Books have slightly lower but similar quantities sold.
Even though the total sales revenue is similar across categories (from the previous chart), the number of items sold varies.
This could mean that clothing items are cheaper but sell in higher volume.
Other Categories have higher-priced items, selling in lower quantities.

Majority of customers are between 20 to 60 years old.
Fewer customers below 20 and above 65.
The distribution is fairly even across mid-age groups, with slight peaks in 25–35 and 45–55 ranges.
Most buyers are working-age adults, so marketing can focus more on that age group.
